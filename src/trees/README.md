# Trees

## Binary Trees 

A binary tree is made of nodes, where each node contains a "left" pointer, a "right" pointer, and a data element. Formally, a binary tree is either empty (represented by a null pointer), or is made of a single node, where the left and right pointers (recursive definition ahead) each point to a binary tree. 

A binary search tree, or ordered binary tree, is a type of binary tree where the nodes are arranged in order: for each node all elements in its left subtree are less-or-equal to the node and all values in its right subtree are greater than the node. 

A binary search tree is *different* to a binary tree.
